    You are venturing through the forest on a quest that your father (aka the king) sent you on. He told you to fight the forest monster to bring its one giant eye. That is because your pet griffin is dying of a disease that can only be cured when it drinks the blood from the forest monster's eye. Now you went to the forest and the monster is staring at you with its huge eye. What will you do? <a href="sword_fight.html">Fight</a> the monster or <a href="run_sword.html">run</a> away like a coward.
